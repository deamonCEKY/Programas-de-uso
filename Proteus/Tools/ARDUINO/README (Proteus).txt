The Arduino Toolchain featured here has been copied from the standard
Arduino IDE 1.8.1 installation.

The following  items have been removed to reduce the size:
 - Sub-folders of the drivers\ folder.
 - All elements of the Arduino IDE including the Java folder and everything except 'version.txt' in the lib folder.
 - The hardware\tools\avr\i686-pc-mingw32 folder
 - Bootloaders and Firmware folders from hardware/arduino/avr
 - Tiny AVR and X-Mega AVR gcc libraries from hardware\tools\avr\lib\gcc\avr\4.9.2 and hardware\tools\avr\avr\lib
 - Examples folders from the standard and avr specific library folders in libraries\ and hardware\arduino\avr\libraries\
